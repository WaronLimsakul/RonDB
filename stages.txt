step 1
should be able to
1. input somethign and got unrecognized "error"
2. or if .exit -> exit

step 2
1. recognize meta command
2. know insert and select command type

step 3.1
1. support inseting a row + printing all rows
    - this format "insert id name email" or "select"
    - yes, we have id -> int, name -> varchar32, email -> varchar255 (why not 256?)
2. only in memory
3. support single hardcoded table
- there is sscanf(), like scanf but the read from first argument instead.
- try to enum the error type
- use prepro macro to define sizes or compile time var
